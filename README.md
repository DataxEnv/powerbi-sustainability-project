# 🌱 Power BI Sustainability Project  

This repository documents my **6-day learning journey in Power BI**, built around a **sustainability and environmental** theme.  
The aim is to practice **data transformation, modeling, and visualization** while telling meaningful, data-driven stories on sustainability.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **Day 1 – Urban Farming**  
  - `datasets/` → CSV/Excel datasets used  
  - `.pbix_file/` → Power BI report files  
  - `.png/` → Screenshots of dashboards and insight notes  

Subsequent folders (**Day 2–6**) will cover:  
- Data transformation  
- Data modeling  
- Advanced visualizations  
- Storytelling and dashboards  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals  
- Strengthen my Power BI skills in **data modeling, visualization, and basic transformation**  
  *(Note: I prefer handling most transformations and cleaning with Pandas or SQL before bringing data into Power BI.)*  
- Apply analytics to **real-world sustainability datasets**  

---

## 🌍 Day 1 – Urban Farming  
- Designed and generated a sample dataset: **`Urban_Farming.csv`**  
- Imported data into Power BI and explored the interface  
- Built a **basic visualization and insights dashboard** (`day1_visualization.png` and `day1_insights.png`)  
- Focus: city-level crop yields and production patterns

## 🌳 Day 2 – Tree Planting Analysis  
- Developed a **star schema** with fact and dimension tables (Cities, Species, Tree_Planting)  
- Created key **DAX measures** (Total Trees, Avg Trees per Planting, CO₂ Absorption Estimate, % by Species)  
- Designed an interactive dashboard with region, city, and species breakdowns  
- **Key Insight:** Southwest region & Port Harcourt lead in planting efforts.
